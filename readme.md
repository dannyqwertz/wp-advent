Enables advent calendars on your WordPress blog.


## Description 
With this plugin you can create a advent calendar on your WP site.

It is using shortcodes, so it is possible to add the calendar to a regular post, a page or any other post type.

Multiple calendars and calendar years are supported.

We have a public git repository at [https://github.com/lostfocus/wp-advent](https://github.com/lostfocus/wp-advent) and we're happy to answer to questions here and there.
Pull requests are obviously also very welcome.


## Upgrade Notice 
We're now loading all theme CSS files and add a few more classes to style the calendar.

### 1.2.3

### 1.2.2

### 1.2.1 
Bugfix.


### 1.2 
The plugin is now ready for WordPress 4.4.
And once your WordPress is updated, you'll be able to shuffle the calendars to make them a little bit more exciting.


### 1.1.2 
Apparently there were two bugs that made it look like sheets were "lost." This update should fix the second bug, too.


### 1.1 
Cleaned up the interface.

There was a bug in an older version of this plugin that prevented some sheets from being attached to a calendar.
We fixed that bug and added a way to attach these "lost" sheets to a calendar.
